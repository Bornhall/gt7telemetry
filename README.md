# gt7telemetry
Python script to access/dump GT7 telemetry data.

Needs to be run from the terminal, and works best with a terminal of at least 120 x 50 characters. The output is in a separate buffer, but you can comment out lines 12-18 to just write to your current terminal (might want to clear the terminal first).

This work is based purely on the shoulders of others. Python script originally from https://github.com/lmirel/mfc/blob/master/clients/gt7racedata.py

Thanks to the help of the people of GTPlanet, specifically the thread https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/gt7-is-compatible-with-motion-rig.410728 and people like Nenkai, Stoobert and more.

If anyone can gain anything from this, feel free to do so!!
